o Explain the difference between the == and the === operator.
  The == operator compaires two objects, as does the ===. Only the ==
  compaires with automatic type conversion and === without. This means 
  that with == the meaning of the two objects need to be the same, whereas
  with === the two object need to be exacly the same.

o Explain what a closure is.
  A closure is a function that makes a local variable but gives that local
  variable back, so the variable is accesable in the next function as well.

o Explain what higher order functions are.
  Higher order functions are functions that ether take or return other 
  functions themselfs. This will make your function shorter, which in turn
  gives; less chance of bugs, shorter code and versatility to the function.
  
o Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript
  that uses a query selector.
  A query selector gives you all the html blocks of the asked for type. An
  example of such a type can be p for <p>, span for <span> or .name for a 
  class called name. querySelector will give you the first element if there
  and querySelectorAll will give all the elements with that tag.
  For instance the next piece of code will color all elements with a class named
  color turn blue.
  function makeColor(color){
    if (typeof(color) != typeof("")){
      break;
      }
    x = document.querySelectorAll(".color");
    for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i ++){
      x[i].style.color = color;
      }
    }
