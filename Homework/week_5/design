For this weeks line graph I chose to show the lines in the most contrasting colours posible, which were blue and orange. 
To show the third line I chose gray because that contrasted most to the blue and orange.
For clarity I chose to do the crosshairs in the matching colours and add a legend.
In the dropdown I chose to do a gray button for nutrality and to not take away from the graph.
For the options in the dropdown I chose to also make them buttons because they are options.
I chose to flip the information that is linked to the crosshair from the top to the bottom and from left to right
because it would otherwise go over the graph making it invisible or making the legend invisible.
