Going through the script top to bottem these are my style choices:
o A width of 1000 and height of 350 gave me a nice bar graph that was as big as 
  possible in one window.
o The barwidth gives you enough room to see the data.
o I made a x axis for the data points and a x axis with the letters of the aphabet,
  because the letters of the alphabet are better titles than the number of the 
  position in the alphabet.
o I started the y axis on -1 to be able to see all the data, if i started at 0
  the bars for q, x and y would be invisible and you would be unable to hover over them.
o I made "g" divs for the axis with class attributes to see them seperately in html.
o I appended a title atop of the Chart for information.
o I made the bars dark blue because I realy like the color and changed it to a dark
  red when your mouse hits it. Also when your mouse hits the rect it finds the data
  that matches that bar and makes it visible.
  this so only the text of the bar you are interested in is visible and you dont get 
  overwelmed with information.
o Than I made the data white because the bars are a dark colour so they stand out.
