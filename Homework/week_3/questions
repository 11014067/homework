o How can D3 acces and change the DOM? What do select and select All do?
    You can have a div and the D3 can read through the script and find the div and 
    dump stuf in it or take information out of it. Select and select All are comments
    you can use to find the div or divs you are looking for and if you want to you can
    append a wanted change to that function.
    
o What are the d and i in function(d){} and function(d, i){}?
    d is the dataset that you past on to d3 before you started the function.
    i is the index in the dataset you are at. So if you have used d[0] and d[1] in a
    dataset with length 6. Than the next time you cal function(d, i){} i will be 2.
   
o Write sample lines of JavaScript to add a div element with class "barChart1" and
  to add a svg element with class "barChart2" with square dimensions.
     var svgDiv = d3.select(".svgDiv")
     var barChart1 = svgDiv.append("svg")
                            .attr("class", "barChart1")
     var barChart2 = svgDiv.selectAll("svg[class='barChart1']")
                            .data(barChart2Data)
                            .enter()
                            .append("rect")
                                .attr("x", 20)
                                .attr("y", 25)
                                .attr("height", 5)
                                .attr("width", 5)
                                .attr("class", "barChart2")
    
o Describe append, updata, enter, and exit at a high level. What does "selectAll + 
  data + enter + append" refer to?
    select All selects all of a thing if there.
    data gives it a dataset.
    enter prepares an element for a new part of the dataset.
    append creates a div for that part of the dataset.
    
o What are the main differences between drawing a bar chart in HTML and SVG?
   In SVG everything is bound together and scale them because they have a mutual script.
     Also you can put items everywhere, when if comes over top of other thing than the last thing is on top.
     While with HTML you have to put a lot of effert in and give it a index etc.

o In drawing the simple bar chart with D3 and SVG, what elements were appended, and what
  parts of the graph did these elements correspond to?
    rect's where appended for each of the bars in the bar graph.
    text's where appended for text like the title.
    g's where appended for the axis.
